    "#### the for loop has two main variants: (i) the indexed control variable form and (ii) the iterator form\n",
    "When you want to execute code repeatedly and a fixed number of times the best tool in python (and most langauges) is the for loop. Most languages such as python, java, C#, etc. have an easy to use special form called the iterator that allows you to write a very quick loop over a collection of data. Here we will have some list L filled with integers and can write an easy loop to work on every element of the list in two different ways. Keep in mind you need to learn how to use both forms."

When you want to keep track of the order of a particuliar value or are dealing with ordinal type probnlems which will come later in the course the iterator version will not be sufficient!
