This repository has my work for the Introduction to Computer Science class taught by [Timothy Becker](https://www.conncoll.edu/directories/faculty-profiles/timothy-becker/).

This class is the first in the Computer Science major and minor and is also open to students from other academic departments. 

It includes my [Homeworks](Homeworks), [Programming Assignments](Programming%20Assignments) and weekly [lab](Labs) assignments.
